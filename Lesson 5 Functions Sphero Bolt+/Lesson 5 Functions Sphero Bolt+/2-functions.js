async function startProgram() {
	// The actions we used in the previous block of code were METHODS - functions that are attached to an object (the robot, in this case). FUNCTIONS are standalone blocks of code that can be called from anywhere in the program. They are reusable and can take parameters to customize their behavior.

	// STEP 7: Call or invoke the celebrate FUNCTION
	
	// STEP 8: Wait for 2 seconds using the delay METHOD
	
	// STEP 9: Call the celebrate function again
	
}

// STEP 1: Create a FUNCTION called celebrate (note that we are outside of the main program block)

	// STEP 2: Set the main LED color to red

	// STEP 3: Roll the robot

	// STEP 4: Set the main LED color to blue

	// STEP 5: Roll the robot again

	// STEP 6: Play a random sound (we add a parameter of false to the play method of the Sound object, which means it will not wait for the sound to finish before continuing)
