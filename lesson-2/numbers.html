        /* STEP 1: Number types (integer, float, and double)
        declare and initialize an integer and a float, then in the console, reveal the number type with typeof(varName) */

        let myFloat = 6.23456;
        let myDouble = 7.3455634535344535344;

        let myHex = 0x04F6E2;

        // Note - there are also different number systems: binary, octal, and hexadecimal

        /* STEP 2: Arithmetic operators
        + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (remainder or modulo), ** (exponent) */

        console.log(`The value of step2b is ${step2b}.`);
        /* OR… num1 * num2 / 8 + 2 - 0.5; */

        /* Keep in mind operator precedence, just like you were taught in math class (/, *, +, -)
        num1 + num2 * 5 - 25 ... is not 575 ... it is 215 */

        (num1 + num2) * 5 - 25 */

        /* STEP 3: Increment and decrement operators
        ++ and -- are mostly found inside loops to move a counter variable to the next value when needed, either up or down. */

        // Note 1 - you cannot increment/decrement a number directly
        // Note 2 - typing num++ or num-- in the console will output the number before incrementing or decrmenting - try ++num or --num, instead

        /* STEP 4: Assignment Operators
        = (assignment), += (addition assignment), -= (subtraction assignment), *= (multiplication assignment), /= (division assignment) */
